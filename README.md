OPTICAL CHARACTER RECOGNITION[OSR]

Digit Recognition


Overview
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) has been one of the most appealing approaches of success in challenging ML applications such as object detection or face recognition.
That's why we have considered CNN as our main model for our challenging task of image classification.
Digit Recognition is basically used in different tasks of our real-life work purposes.
It's used in banks for reading checks and in detecting number plate of vehicles like at toll plazas and many other places and other related tasks.
In future it may be used for further requirements.

Project Description
We have made an object recognition or detecting application that's used to predict output of handwritten images basically digits that's why it's being known a digit recognition application.
We used Support Vector Classifier [SVC] and sequential model of keras for creating this predictive model. We trained our SVC for MNIST dataset. We created a sequential model in keras and trained it on MNIST dataset.


NOTE:
So below is a list of several modules or libraries or algorithms needed for running this application:

1.scikit-learn[sklearn]:It's a free software machine learning library for the python programming language. It features various classification, regression and clustering algorithms including support-vector machines, k-means, etc. and is designed to interoperate with python numerical and scientific libraries like Numpy.

2.keras: It's an open-source software library that provides a python interface for artificial neural networks. It acts as an interface for the TensorFlow library.

3.TenserFlow: It's a free and open-source software library for machine learning and artificial intelligence. It's used in training and inference of deep neural networks.

4.OpenCV: It's a library of programming functions mainly aimed at real-time computer vision.

5.Pygame: It's a cross platform set of python modules designed for writing video game.

6.NumPy: It's a library for the python programming language adding support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a large collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.

7.Matplotlib: It's a plotting library for the python programming language and it's numerical mathematical extension NumPy.

8.Support Vector Classifier [SVC]: It's a supervised machine learning algorithm typically used for classification of tasks.


That's all and the working of the application is shown in the demo video.
